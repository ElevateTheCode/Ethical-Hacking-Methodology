📘 Ethical Hacking Methodology Guide
---
This repository is a structured guide to the six phases of an ethical hacking or penetration testing engagement. Think of this as a step-by-step manual for a professional security audit, similar to a security expert inspecting a house to find all its weaknesses.
The goal of this guide is to provide a clear, easy-to-understand roadmap for anyone interested in learning the correct and methodical way to approach ethical hacking.

🧭 What is the Hacking Methodology?
The Hacking Methodology is a set of defined steps that security professionals follow to find and fix vulnerabilities in a system. Each step builds on the previous one, ensuring that no potential security flaw is missed.

The phases are:
- Information Gathering: Collecting public information about the target.
- Scanning & Enumeration: Actively probing the target to find open services and ports.
- Vulnerability Analysis: Identifying known weaknesses in the services that were found.
- Exploitation: Using a vulnerability to gain a foothold in the system.
- Post-Exploitation: Seeing how much damage a real attacker could cause after getting in.
- Reporting: Writing a detailed report with solutions to fix all the found weaknesses.

✅ How to Use This Guide
This guide is designed to be followed in order. Each folder contains a detailed explanation of a single phase, including its purpose and the common tools used.
Start by reading the Information_Gathering.md file in the 1_Information_Gathering folder.
Move to the next folder only after you have a clear understanding of the current one.
The concepts and tools mentioned in each phase are the foundation for the next.

⚠️ Important Note: The information and tools mentioned in this repository are for educational and ethical purposes only. They must be used strictly on systems for which you have explicit permission to test. Using this information for any unauthorized or illegal activity is a serious offense.
